# Product Context: TCC Monografia

## 1. The "Product"

The product is the final Trabalho de Conclus√£o de Curso (TCC) monograph document, specifically the generated `Monografia.pdf` file.

## 2. Problem Solved

This monograph serves as the formal documentation and presentation of the research or project undertaken as a final requirement for the Control and Automation Engineering degree at UFMG. It addresses the need to:
-   Demonstrate the student's acquired knowledge and skills.
-   Communicate research findings or project results effectively.
-   Fulfill a critical academic requirement for graduation.

## 3. How It Should Work (User Experience)

-   **Clarity:** The text should be clear, concise, and academically rigorous.
-   **Structure:** The document must follow a logical flow, typically including sections like Abstract, Introduction, Literature Review (or Background), Methodology, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, and References. The existing LaTeX structure (`Introducao/`, `Metodologia/`, etc.) reflects this.
-   **Formatting:** Adherence to UFMG's formatting guidelines (margins, fonts, spacing, citation style) is crucial for a professional presentation.
-   **Completeness:** All required sections and components (figures, tables, appendices) must be included.
-   **Accuracy:** Technical details, data, and references must be accurate.

## 4. Target Audience

-   **Primary:** The TCC evaluation committee (professors) at UFMG.
-   **Secondary:** Other students, researchers, or faculty members within the Control and Automation Engineering field or related areas who might consult the work.
