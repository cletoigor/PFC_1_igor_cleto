# Active Context: TCC Monografia - Initial Setup

## 1. Current Focus

-   Establishing the initial Memory Bank structure (`memory-bank/` directory and core files).
-   Creating the `.clinerules` file for project-specific guidelines.
-   Populating these initial documentation files with baseline information derived from the project's nature (UFMG TCC) and existing file structure.

## 2. Recent Changes

-   Created `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`.
-   Created `memory-bank/productContext.md`.

## 3. Next Steps

-   Create `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`.
-   Create `memory-bank/techContext.md`.
-   Create `memory-bank/progress.md`.
-   Create `.clinerules`.
-   Begin populating the Memory Bank files with more specific details about the TCC topic, progress, and any known issues or decisions.
-   Continue working on the content of the LaTeX source files (`.tex`).

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

-   The Memory Bank structure is being created within a `memory-bank/` subdirectory.
-   Initial content is based on the general requirements of a UFMG TCC in Control and Automation Engineering. This will need refinement as the project progresses.
