# Progress: TCC Monografia - Initial State

## 1. What Works / Completed

-   **Basic Project Structure:** A modular LaTeX project structure is in place with separate directories and `.tex` files for major sections (Introduction, Methodology, Results, Conclusion, Appendices, etc.).
-   **Bibliography File:** `ListadeReferencias.bib` exists for storing references.
-   **Main Document File:** `Monografia.tex` exists, likely serving as the entry point for compilation.
-   **Supporting Files:** Files for generating the cover, acknowledgements, abstract, lists of figures/tables, and table of contents exist.
-   **Initial Memory Bank:** Core files created and populated with baseline info.
-   **Compilation Setup (LaTeX):** Evidence of `latexmk` usage suggests an automated compilation process is likely functional.
-   **Data Pipeline Orchestration (Dagster):**
    -   Added Dagster dependencies (`dagster`, `dagster-duckdb`, `dagster-webserver`) to `app/requirements.txt`.
    -   Refactored ingestion and processing logic into Dagster assets (`raw_tuya_logs`, `staging_tuya_logs`) in `app/assets.py`.
    -   Created helper functions module `app/data_ingestion/ingestion_utils.py`.
    -   Defined a Dagster job (`tuya_processing_job`) targeting both assets.
    -   Defined an hourly schedule (`hourly_schedule`) for the job.
    -   Configured `DuckDBResource` (in-memory) and `TuyaCredentials` Config (using EnvVar) in `app/assets.py`.
    -   Created Dagster instance configuration (`dagster.yaml`) and workspace definition (`workspace.yaml`).
-   **Memory Bank Update:** `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md` updated to reflect the Dagster implementation.

## 2. What's Left to Build / In Progress

-   **Content Population:** Most `.tex` files likely require significant writing or completion of content specific to the TCC topic. (Requires review of individual `.tex` files).
-   **Figures and Tables:** Inclusion and refinement of all necessary figures and tables.
-   **Bibliography Entries:** Populating `ListadeReferencias.bib` with all required references and ensuring they are cited correctly in the text.
-   **Formatting Refinement:** Ensuring strict adherence to UFMG formatting guidelines.
-   **Review and Revision:** Thorough proofreading, technical review, and revisions based on feedback.
-   **`.clinerules`:** Creation and population of the `.clinerules` file (ongoing).
-   **Memory Bank Refinement:** Updating Memory Bank files with specific project details as work progresses (ongoing).
-   **Dagster Verification:** Starting `dagster dev` and verifying the pipeline runs correctly via UI and schedule.
-   **Data Pipeline Utilization:** Defining and implementing downstream uses for the partitioned Parquet dataset in `app/data/staging/`.

## 3. Current Status Snapshot (as of 2025-04-26)

-   The foundational LaTeX structure and Memory Bank framework are established.
-   The data pipeline (raw JSON -> staging Parquet) is now implemented and orchestrated using Dagster assets, jobs, resources, and schedules.
-   The pipeline is scheduled to run hourly.
-   Memory Bank documentation has been updated to reflect the Dagster implementation.
-   The next immediate step for the data pipeline is to start the Dagster UI/daemon and verify its operation.
-   The core task for the monograph itself remains writing/completing content.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

-   **Dagster Runtime:** Potential issues related to environment variables not being accessible to the Dagster process, Python environment inconsistencies, or Dagster daemon/UI startup problems.
-   **API/Network:** Potential failures in the `raw_tuya_logs` asset due to Tuya API rate limits, credential errors, or network connectivity issues.
-   **Data Schema/Mapping:** Potential failures in `staging_tuya_logs` if the raw JSON schema changes unexpectedly or if `device_mapping.json` is missing/corrupt.
-   **Resource Configuration:** The in-memory DuckDB resource will lose state between runs; may need reconfiguration to a file DB if persistence is needed. Dagster instance storage defaults might need adjustment for long-term use.
-   **LaTeX:** Potential issues remain as listed previously (compilation errors, formatting, content completion).
