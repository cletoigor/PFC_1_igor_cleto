# Progress: TCC Monografia - Initial State

## 1. What Works / Completed

-   **Basic Project Structure:** A modular LaTeX project structure is in place with separate directories and `.tex` files for major sections (Introduction, Methodology, Results, Conclusion, Appendices, etc.).
-   **Bibliography File:** `ListadeReferencias.bib` exists for storing references.
-   **Main Document File:** `Monografia.tex` exists, likely serving as the entry point for compilation.
-   **Supporting Files:** Files for generating the cover, acknowledgements, abstract, lists of figures/tables, and table of contents exist.
-   **Initial Memory Bank:** The core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) have been created with baseline information.
-   **Compilation Setup:** Evidence of `latexmk` usage suggests an automated compilation process is likely functional. The presence of `Monografia.pdf` indicates successful compilation at some point.

## 2. What's Left to Build / In Progress

-   **Content Population:** Most `.tex` files likely require significant writing or completion of content specific to the TCC topic. (Requires review of individual `.tex` files).
-   **Figures and Tables:** Inclusion and refinement of all necessary figures and tables.
-   **Bibliography Entries:** Populating `ListadeReferencias.bib` with all required references and ensuring they are cited correctly in the text.
-   **Formatting Refinement:** Ensuring strict adherence to UFMG formatting guidelines.
-   **Review and Revision:** Thorough proofreading, technical review, and revisions based on feedback.
-   **`.clinerules`:** Creation and population of the `.clinerules` file.
-   **Memory Bank Refinement:** Updating Memory Bank files with specific project details as work progresses.

## 3. Current Status Snapshot (as of 2025-04-20)

-   The foundational LaTeX structure and Memory Bank framework are established.
-   The core task is now focused on writing/completing the monograph's content and refining the existing structure and documentation.
-   The exact completeness of each section (`.tex` file) is unknown without reviewing their content.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

-   None explicitly identified yet. Potential issues could arise from:
    -   LaTeX compilation errors.
    -   Formatting inconsistencies.
    -   Incomplete sections or references.
    -   Missing figures or data.
