# Progress: TCC Monografia - Initial State

## 1. What Works / Completed

-   **Basic Project Structure:** A modular LaTeX project structure is in place with separate directories and `.tex` files for major sections (Introduction, Methodology, Results, Conclusion, Appendices, etc.).
-   **Bibliography File:** `ListadeReferencias.bib` exists for storing references.
-   **Main Document File:** `Monografia.tex` exists, likely serving as the entry point for compilation.
-   **Supporting Files:** Files for generating the cover, acknowledgements, abstract, lists of figures/tables, and table of contents exist.
-   **Initial Memory Bank:** Core files created and populated with baseline info.
-   **Compilation Setup (LaTeX):** Evidence of `latexmk` usage suggests an automated compilation process is likely functional.
-   **Data Pipeline (Raw to Staging):**
    -   Dependencies (`duckdb`, `pandas`) added to `app/requirements.txt`.
    -   `app/data_ingestion/tuya_log_ingestion.py` updated to add `device_id` field to raw JSON records.
    -   `app/data/staging/` directory created.
    -   `app/data_processing/process_raw_to_staging.py` script updated to:
        - Read raw JSON (including `device_id`).
        - Add `filename` column.
        - Replace `event_time` (ms) with a readable timestamp format (aliased as `event_time`).
        - Look up `device_name` from `device_mapping.json`.
        - Derive `event_date` (from original ms timestamp).
        - Write daily partitioned Parquet files using `PARTITION_BY(event_date)`.
    -   Old single `staging_logs.parquet` file removed.
    -   Dependencies installed and processing script successfully executed, generating partitioned Parquet files in `app/data/staging/` with final schema (including replaced `event_time`, `device_id`, `filename`, `device_name`).
-   **Memory Bank Update:** `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md` updated to reflect the final enhanced and partitioned data pipeline implementation.

## 2. What's Left to Build / In Progress

-   **Content Population:** Most `.tex` files likely require significant writing or completion of content specific to the TCC topic. (Requires review of individual `.tex` files).
-   **Figures and Tables:** Inclusion and refinement of all necessary figures and tables.
-   **Bibliography Entries:** Populating `ListadeReferencias.bib` with all required references and ensuring they are cited correctly in the text.
-   **Formatting Refinement:** Ensuring strict adherence to UFMG formatting guidelines.
-   **Review and Revision:** Thorough proofreading, technical review, and revisions based on feedback.
-   **`.clinerules`:** Creation and population of the `.clinerules` file.
-   **Memory Bank Refinement:** Updating Memory Bank files (including this one) with specific project details as work progresses.
-   **Data Pipeline Utilization:** Defining and implementing downstream uses for the partitioned Parquet dataset in `app/data/staging/`.

## 3. Current Status Snapshot (as of 2025-04-25)

-   The foundational LaTeX structure and Memory Bank framework are established.
-   A data pipeline (raw JSON -> daily partitioned staging Parquet) using DuckDB is implemented and functional, including replacement of `event_time` with a readable timestamp and device name enrichment.
-   The core task is now focused on writing/completing the monograph's content and refining the existing structure and documentation.
-   The exact completeness of each section (`.tex` file) is unknown without reviewing their content.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers

-   None explicitly identified yet. Potential issues could arise from:
    -   LaTeX compilation errors.
    -   Formatting inconsistencies.
    -   Incomplete sections or references.
    -   Missing figures or data for the monograph.
-   Potential schema changes in raw JSON data (including `device_id`, `event_time`) or `device_mapping.json` affecting the processing script.
-   Scalability of the in-memory DuckDB process if raw data volume grows significantly.
