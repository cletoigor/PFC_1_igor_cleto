This project aims to develop an intelligent system for monitoring and predicting energy consumption in homes that were not originally designed for home automation. Specifically, it seeks to conduct research and analysis of existing technologies that allow energy monitoring without the need for prior infrastructure, explore suitable solutions for conventional residences, develop a prototype of a monitoring system that is easy to install and use, implement data processing algorithms and consumption forecasting using artificial intelligence techniques and statistical process control, create an intuitive software platform for data visualization and analysis by users, test and validate the system in a real environment to ensure its efficiency and usability, promote the feasibility of large-scale implementation through cost analysis and adoption strategies, and document and disseminate the results obtained, highlighting the contributions to Control and Automation Engineering and the social and environmental benefits provided by the developed system.
