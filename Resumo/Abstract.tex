This project aims to develop an intelligent system for monitoring and forecasting energy consumption in homes that were not originally designed for home automation. Specifically, it seeks to research and analyze existing technologies that allow energy monitoring without requiring prior infrastructure, and to explore solutions suitable for conventional residences. The project will involve the development of a prototype for an easily installable and user-friendly monitoring system, as well as the implementation of data processing algorithms and consumption forecasting using artificial intelligence techniques. An intuitive software platform will be created for users to visualize and analyze the data, and the system will be tested and validated in a real-world environment to ensure its efficiency and usability. To promote the feasibility of large-scale implementation, the project will include cost analysis and strategies for adoption. Finally, the results will be documented and disseminated, emphasizing the contributions to Control and Automation Engineering and the social and environmental benefits provided by the developed system.
